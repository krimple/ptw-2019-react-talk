# React Fundamentals Lab Book
## Chariot Solutions Education Services

## Overview

This book contains exercises and labs to use as practice for your React and
Friends training course.

All labs are contained in a lab.zip file - simply unzip them into a directory
named `labs` and open them with your favorite editor.

We've used a number of `npm-based` projects to run our exercises. The following
installations should be done (once your NodeJs build environment is configured):

```bash
npm install -g babel-cli
npm install -g create-react-app
```

For each lab, as you begin, you'll want to open a command-line prompt in that
directory and execute:

```bash
npm install
```

which will install all dependencies for the lab in question.
